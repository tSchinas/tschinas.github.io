  - title: "Systems Design"
  - excerpt: "My main role on the project was that of system designer, a role I had yet to play. After the design team had decided upon the mechanics we wanted to include in the game, I began designing the underlying systems that would support those mechanics. The main system I will highlight here is the "stamina" system, which eventually would come to be called the chalk system."
