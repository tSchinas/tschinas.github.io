    title: "<b>Systems Design</b>"
    excerpt: "<p align=justify>My main role on the project was that of system designer, a role I had yet to play. After the design team had decided upon the mechanics we wanted to include in the game, I began designing the underlying systems that would support those mechanics. The main system I will highlight here is the \"stamina\" system, which eventually would come to be called the chalk system.</p>"
