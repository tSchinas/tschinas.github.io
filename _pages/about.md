    excerpt: |
      Hi! I'm a former release manager and localization producer now studying game design at Futuregames. My experience has taken me from my home in the US, to Tokyo, Japan, and now to Stockholm.<br><br>
      I've played games for as long as I can remember; I still remember opening my Game Boy Color on Christmas, sitting underneath the tree and starting my Pokémon journey. And they came to mean so much more over the years, leading me through life, and through love.<br><br>
      I'm also very interested in reading. Games became the natural extension of my desire to turn the page, the interactivity providing that extra dash of immersion in a story.<br><br>
      Game design to me combines two of my greatest professional loves: complex problem solving and careful planning. Cooperating with people from all over the world to serve up joy, or to help reconcile, or to move to tears—all in one single medium... What could be better than that?<br><br>
      Outside of games, I spend time playing or listening to music, baking, and studying new languages.
