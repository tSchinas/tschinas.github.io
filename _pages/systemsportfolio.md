<p>I am a game system designer residing in Sweden and studying at Futuregames, Stockholm. Previous to design, I also worked in localization and release management for 4 years at Sega, Oizumi Amuzio, and as a freelancer. My past roles have helped me learn a great deal about how games are made, and I leverage that experience while designing and working with others.</p>
