intro: 
  - excerpt: "<br/>I am a game system designer residing in Sweden and studying at Futuregames, Stockholm. Previous to design, I also worked in localization and release management for 4 years at Sega, Oizumi Amuzio, and as a freelancer. My past roles have helped me learn a great deal about how games are made, and I aim to wield that experience to maintain a holistic view of a project and its systems, mapping and connecting its components, decomposing them into smaller parts and ensuring they come together to build the whole."
